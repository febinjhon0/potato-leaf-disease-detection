# potato-leaf-disease-detection
Potato Disease Classification using TensorFlow is a project designed to identify three types of potato plant health: Early Blight, Healthy, and Late Blight. This machine learning model employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images, aiding farmers in early disease detection and crop protection.
